# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

Vanilla CSS and JS. Was pretty fun learning how to use grid for the layout of the page. Pretty straightforward and I really like the color palette of the original designs.

Had some issues finding the right scaling for medium sized screens. The large and mobile views turned out pretty well i thought.
